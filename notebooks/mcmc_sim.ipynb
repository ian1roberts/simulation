    "# üÉè Learning with Markov Chains: A Monte Carlo Simulation of Card Rank Transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the foundations of **Markov Chain modeling** through the lens of card drawing ‚Äî a familiar context where *randomness and dependency* intersect. Inspired by the work of **Andrey Markov**, who famously analyzed patterns in Russian literature to illustrate dependencies in sequences of letters, we apply similar reasoning to the transitions between **card ranks** in a shuffled deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to simulate and visualize how the rank of a card affects the rank of the card that follows it. Specifically, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ignore suits** and focus only on card ranks (1 to 13, Ace to King).\n",
    "2. Simulate thousands of **shuffled deck draws** and record transitions between adjacent card ranks.\n",
    "3. **Construct a transition matrix** to represent the empirical probabilities of one rank following another.\n",
    "4. Use this matrix to **generate sequences** and explore how Markovian memory influences predictions.\n",
    "5. Visualize these patterns with **heatmaps** and **distributions** to build intuitive understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Why Markov Chains?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Markov Chain** models systems where the next state depends only on the *current* state ‚Äî not the full history. This is ideal for modeling card rank transitions, where our interest is in the likelihood of a particular rank appearing immediately after another, based on observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **Monte Carlo simulation** ‚Äî random sampling ‚Äî to empirically estimate these probabilities. Although the underlying deck is randomly shuffled, patterns emerge when we observe enough trials, allowing us to construct a **data-driven probabilistic model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ Learning by Doing\n",

    "- The power of simple systems to reveal structure through iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "It lays the groundwork for future work modeling more complex dependencies, such as the actual rules of solitaire, or stateful systems in language, genetics, or behavior.\n",
