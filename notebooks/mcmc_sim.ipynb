    "# 🃏 Learning with Markov Chains: A Monte Carlo Simulation of Card Rank Transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the foundations of **Markov Chain modeling** through the lens of card drawing — a familiar context where *randomness and dependency* intersect. Inspired by the work of **Andrey Markov**, who famously analyzed patterns in Russian literature to illustrate dependencies in sequences of letters, we apply similar reasoning to the transitions between **card ranks** in a shuffled deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to simulate and visualize how the rank of a card affects the rank of the card that follows it. Specifically, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ignore suits** and focus only on card ranks (1 to 13, Ace to King).\n",
    "2. Simulate thousands of **shuffled deck draws** and record transitions between adjacent card ranks.\n",
    "3. **Construct a transition matrix** to represent the empirical probabilities of one rank following another.\n",
    "4. Use this matrix to **generate sequences** and explore how Markovian memory influences predictions.\n",
    "5. Visualize these patterns with **heatmaps** and **distributions** to build intuitive understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why Markov Chains?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Markov Chain** models systems where the next state depends only on the *current* state — not the full history. This is ideal for modeling card rank transitions, where our interest is in the likelihood of a particular rank appearing immediately after another, based on observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **Monte Carlo simulation** — random sampling — to empirically estimate these probabilities. Although the underlying deck is randomly shuffled, patterns emerge when we observe enough trials, allowing us to construct a **data-driven probabilistic model**.\n",
